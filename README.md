# README

Simple example code for square matrix multiplication in C, Fortran and Python. Python and C call all the functions included in the library.

The Fortran and the C code are compiled in the same library and are called directly using the old Fortran method when needed.

The only external dependencies are blass and numpy. All the codes are optimized based on the original BLAS routine.

To compile, gcc and gfortran are also needed.
